- ["Cosmos" 14 episodes by Carl Sagan](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfCc7ZJjHiM&list=PLyuW1ECdbdjrPmqxuC7vCXzgPAIc6YOTq)  
Carl Sagan opens the program with a description of the cosmos and a "Spaceship of the Imagination" (shaped like a dandelion seed). 
The ship journeys through the universe's hundred billion galaxies, the Local Group, the Andromeda Galaxy, the Milky Way, the Orion Nebula, our Solar System, and finally the planet Earth. Eratosthenes' successful calculation of the circumference of Earth leads to a description of the ancient Library of Alexandria. Finally, the "Ages of Science" are described, before pulling back to the full span of the Cosmic Calendar. Note: the revised version of the series adds an introduction by Ann Druyan to this episode, in which she discusses some of the changes that occurred in the years after its broadcast
